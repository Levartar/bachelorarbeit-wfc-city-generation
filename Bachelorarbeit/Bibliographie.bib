	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07307},
	abstract = {Wave Function Collapse (WFC) is a widely used tilebased algorithm in procedural content generation, including textures, objects, and scenes. However, the current WFC algorithm and related research lack the ability to generate commercialized large-scale or infinite content due to constraint conflict and time complexity costs. This paper proposes a Nested WFC (NWFC) algorithm framework to reduce time complexity. To avoid conflict and backtracking problems, we offer a complete and sub-complete tileset preparation strategy, which requires only a small number of tiles to generate aperiodic and deterministic infinite content. We also introduce the weight-brush system that combines N-WFC and sub-complete tileset, proving its suitability for game design. Our contribution addresses WFC’s challenge in massive content generation and provides a theoretical basis for implementing concrete games.},

	abstract = {The computer game industry requires a skilled workforce and this combined with the complexity of modern games, means that production costs are extremely high. One of the most time consuming aspects is the creation of game geometry, the virtual world which the players inhabit. Procedural techniques have been used within computer graphics to create natural textures, simulate special effects and generate complex natural models including trees and waterfalls. It is these procedural techniques that we intend to harness to generate geometry and textures suitable for a game situated in an urban environment. Procedural techniques can provide many benefits for computer graphics applications when the correct algorithm is used. An overview of several commonly used procedural techniques including fractals, L-systems, Perlin noise, tiling systems and cellular basis is provided. The function of each technique and the resulting output they create are discussed to better understand their characteristics, benefits and relevance to the city generation problem. City generation is the creation of an urban area which necessitates the creation of buildings, situated along streets and arranged in appropriate patterns. Some research has already taken place into recreating road network patterns and generating buildings that can vary in function and architectural style. We will study the main body of existing research into procedural city generation and provide an overview of their implementations and a critique of their functionality and results. Finally we present areas in which further research into the generation of cities is required and outline our research goals for city generation.},

	abstract = {The common trend in the scientific inquiry of urban areas and their populations is to use real-world geographic and population data to understand, explain, and predict urban phenomena. We argue that this trend limits our understanding of urban areas as dealing with arbitrarily collected geographic data requires technical expertise to process; moreover, population data is often aggregated, sparsified, or anonymized for privacy reasons. We believe synthetic urban areas generated via procedural city generation, which is a technique mostly used in the gaming area, could help improve the state-of-the-art in many disciplines which study urban areas. In this paper, we describe a selection of research areas that could benefit from such synthetic urban data and show that the current research in procedurally generated cities needs to address specific issues (e.g., plausibility) to sufficiently capture real-world cities and thus take such data beyond gaming.},

@article{morris_modifying_nodate,
	title = {Modifying {Wave} {Function} {Collapse} for more {Complex} {Use} in {Game} {Generation} and {Design}},
	abstract = {Wave Function Collapse (WFC) is an image-based Procedural Content Generation (PCG) algorithm that uses constraints extracted from an input image to generate a similar, yet novel output. The goal of this thesis is to modify WFC with extra constraints and parameters that would allow a game designer to have more control over the algorithm to produce more varied and speciﬁc results. This thesis introduces the ﬁeld of Procedural Content Generation (of which Wave Function Collapse is a part) and details the WFC algorithm. It then examines past work done in these two topics, along with developments in the ﬁeld of content generation for the game Super Mario Bros. and developments of heuristics used to analyze PCG content. The thesis next explains the speciﬁcs of WFC’s core algorithm, introduces the new modiﬁcations made to it, and details heuristics used to analyze its output. Finally, experiments are run using these modiﬁcations to generate content using levels from the original Super Mario Bros. as input, and previously introduced heuristics are used to assess the results.},

	abstract = {This project combines Wave Function Collapse and Growing Grids to create an improved procedural content generator that creates diverse output. A solution for traversal and feature distribution was also implemented. The results were evaluated by measuring the difficulty of navigating maps created. Another evaluation measured the recognizability of maps created with the system. A visual inspection was also done to showcase the capabilities. The results showed that navigation was significantly harder in maps created with the system compared to maps created with the original WFC algorithm. The results from the second test showed that it was slightly easier for the evaluation participants to recognize the maps created with the system compared to maps created with the original WFC algorithm.},
