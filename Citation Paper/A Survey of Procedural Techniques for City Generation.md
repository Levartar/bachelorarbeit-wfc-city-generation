##### S. 90 Parametric Control:
*Parameters are defined and adjusted that directly correspond to a specific behaviour in the procedural generation. The developer can define as many useful controls as required for the artists to
operate effectively*

##### S. 100 Perlin Noise
*As a procedural generation technique Perlin Noise provides a comprehensive set of benefits. Parametric control provides the developer with flexibility to control the output through high level parameters.*

##### S. 104 Roads
*Road networks are a key aspect of city character and identity. Road networks are difficult to generalize since they are an interwoven component of a complex system*

*The patterns applied within a city are a result of numerous factors including
location, geography, cultural influences, planning trends, etc.*

##### S. 104 Cities
*The number of roles for buildings is many and combined with the geographic composition within a city make for an extremely complex system. Such a complex system is difficult to model, but a simplified solution can be used, similar to that used in statistical analysis, that uses classes or groups to model building function.*

*Usage groups such as commercial, residential and industrial can be used as select generalizations for the numerous building roles and a simple mechanism for modelling function within cities.*

##### S. 118 Districts
*Three distinct developer types are defined: residential, commercial and industrial. All developers seek to increase the value of their land and each developer type evaluates the value of land differently and uses a different set of rules to complete its goals. For example: residential developers seek land near the less busy areas of the road network in contrast to commercial developers who look for the busiest sections of the road network.*
