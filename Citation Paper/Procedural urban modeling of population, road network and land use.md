#### Seite 2. Overwiev 2.1 Definitions
*The road network in our system, in accordance with the widely used road hierarchy (Lay, 2009; Marshall, 2005), consists of the highway, arterial, distributor (district and local), and local access. Accordingly, in our definition, a city is divided into districts, and a district into neighborhoods, then into lots. The district is an area surrounded by highways and arterials, and the neighborhood is surrounded by distributors, and the lot is surrounded by local accesses. Finally, at this stage we consider a set of five land uses: the residential, the industrial, the office, the retail and services, and the park and open space.*
