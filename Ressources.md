Replacing car trips by increasing bike and public transport in the greater Barcelona metropolitan area: A health impact assessment study
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160412012001833
-> Barcelona/Madrid Musterstädte für gute Stadtplanung

*The annual health impact of a shift of 40% of the car trips, starting and ending in Barcelona City, to cycling (n = 141,690) would be for the travellers who shift modes 1.15 additional deaths from air pollution, 0.17 additional deaths from road traffic fatality and 67.46 deaths avoided from physical activity resulting in a total of 66.12 deaths avoided.*
