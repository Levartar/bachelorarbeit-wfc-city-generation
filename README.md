# Procedural City Generation with Wave Function Collapse

This repository contains the code and data for my bachelor’s thesis, *Procedural City Generation with Wave Function Collapse*.

## Project Structure

- **Code/**: Contains the implementation of the city generation algorithm using the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) technique.
- **Data/**: Stores the logged generation data, including parameters and evaluation metrics.

## Summary

This project demonstrates the use of the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm for procedural city generation. By adapting WFC to work with 3D models, this project generates cities based on irregular quadrilateral grids, creating organic layouts for roads, buildings, rivers, and highways. The algorithm allows user-defined parameters to control the characteristics of the city, including the number of highways, rivers, and different zones (residential, industrial, etc.). The results show how this method can generate complex city layouts efficiently, with minimal manual intervention.

## Video Demo

Here’s a brief demo showcasing the city generation in action:
